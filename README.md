# Rock Paper Scissors
This is the second project in **The Odin Project curriculum**.  
I already knew most of the programming concepts considering my background in Python, 
but it was nice making a first JavaScript project.   
Console based for now, before we return to it later, after we learn
to manipulate the DOM.  
**Version 1.0.0**
